# Wallets tracking
I made my personal tool to group together all data from 10 differents exchanges and blockchains (avalanche, ftm, arbitrum, ethereum, bsc, solana, binance, ftx, kucoin, meria) (REST APIs)

It is able to display on a webpage current overall wallet value ($), assets allocation and historical performance.

MongoDB is used to store this data.
